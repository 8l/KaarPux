    We are not really installing this package, because it introduces a cyclic dependency:
    Building <systemitem>haskell-platform</systemitem> requires <systemitem>Cabal</systemitem>,
    which is installed by <systemitem>haskell-platform</systemitem>.
    Instead we are installing the individual modules,
    with the versions specified by the <systemitem>haskell-platform</systemitem>.
