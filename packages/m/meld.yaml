  short: |
      Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers.
      Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects.
      It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for many popular version control systems.

  <para>
  Note that meld does not work in this version of KaarPux.
  It relies on Python2 and a number of old gnome/python dependencies, which are only used by meld.
  But meld is working on porting to Python3, so hopefully it will be back soon
