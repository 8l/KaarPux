  short: |
      Sed (streams editor) isn't really a true text editor or text processor.
      Instead, it is used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input
      and performs some operation (or set of operations) on it and outputs the modified text.
      Sed is typically used for extracting part of a file
      using pattern matching or substituting multiple occurrences of a string within a file.
